<!-- title: Crossing the AI Moat -->

<p>A series dedicated to asking naive questions about AI and sharing my unrefined thoughts as I try to build a coherent mental model of how these AI systems work and behave in practice.</p>

<p>This is inspired by what Sasha Chapin and Cate Hall call the <a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/learn-to-love-the-moat-of-low-status" target="_blank">moat of low status</a>, the barrier that keeps many of us from learning publicly, even though the embarrassment of being a novice is often smaller than we imagine.</p>
